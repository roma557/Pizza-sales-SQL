🍕 PizzaHut Sales Data Analysis Using SQL

Excited to share my latest SQL project – PizzaHut Sales Analysis 📊

In this project, I analyzed pizza sales data using only SQL to extract meaningful business insights.

🔍 Key Insights Generated:

✅ Category-wise distribution of pizzas
✅ Most commonly ordered pizza size
✅ Highest priced pizzas
✅ Top 5 most ordered pizza types
✅ Hourly order distribution
✅ Total quantity sold by category
✅ Average pizzas ordered per day
✅ Top 3 pizza types based on revenue

Through this project, I practiced and applied:

🔹 SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY
🔹 INNER JOIN
🔹 Aggregate Functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG)
🔹 Revenue Calculations
🔹 Date & Time Analysis

Questions:-
- Calculate the total revenue generated from pizza sales.
- Identify the highest-priced pizza.
- Id entify the most common pizza size ordered.
- List the top 5 most ordered pizza types along with their quantities.


-Join the necessary tables to find the total quantity of each pizza category ordered.
-Determine the distribution of orders by hour of the day.
-Join relevant tables to find the category-wise distribution of pizzas.
-Group the orders by date and calculate the average number of pizzas ordered per day.
-Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue.



Working on this dataset helped me understand how businesses use SQL to transform raw sales data into actionable insights for decision-making and revenue optimization.

I’m continuously improving my skills in SQL, Data Analytics, and Business Intelligence 📈

Would love to hear your feedback! 😊
